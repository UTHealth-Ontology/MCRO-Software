# mco-java-app

## Description

a sample application that uses the MCRO Java library (mco-java)

## Build instructions

The library and the sample application was developed in Netbeans 16 with Java 11. Through Netbeans, you can File > Open Project and select the mco-java-app folder. Select the parent node of the project and use the "Clean and Build" button (or through the Run menu). 

Note that mco-java-app has a dependency on the library (mco-java), so you'll have to build the library first in order to build the sample software application. You may have to add a dependency if it does not register (right click the Dependencies node and select Add Dependency..)
